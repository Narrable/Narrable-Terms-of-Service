Before using the Services, you must (1) open an account with Narrable, (2) select a password and username, and (3) provide registration information such as name and email. The registration information you provide must be accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to provide satisfactory registration information is a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your Narrable account.

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and are solely responsible for all activities resulting from the use of your password and conducted through your Narrable account.

## Teacher Accounts
Narrable will provide you with access to a Teacher Account, provided that you (1) provide any necessary information about you and/or your company or organization when registering the Account and (2) accept the Terms. Using your Teacher Account, you may create invitations for Student Accounts by generating invite codes that you may provide to your Students. You will be responsible for any activities, including any violation of the Terms, that occur under Student Accounts created using your Teacher Account.

## Student Accounts
To create an Account, you must (1) be provided with access to an account invite code by a Teacher, (2) provide Narrable with any Registration Data requested in the registration form, and (3) accept the Terms.

## COPPA
The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, 16 CFR 312, ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, Narrable only collects personal information through the Site from a child under 13 where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the Terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Site and disclose personal information to Narrable for the use and benefit of the learning environment. **If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to Narrable if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what Narrable requests from you in connection with the Services.** If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent having been obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided Narrable personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact Narrable at info@narrable.com. 

If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children who are under 13 years of age will access the Site. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Policy <!--Link? -->. You must keep all consent forms on file and provide them to Narrable if we request them. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Site as part of your curriculum. Further, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to agree to use the Site pursuant to the Terms on behalf of your school and/or district and will use the Site in accordance with COPPA and the Terms.

## Teacher Obligations, Representations and Warranties

  * You are solely responsible for ensuring that you and your company or organization are compliant with all laws and regulations related to disclosing to Narrable the personal information of the Students you invite to create Accounts. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you represent and warrant, that you have provided the necessary notice and obtained the appropriate consent from the Students, or from the parents of the Student if such Student is younger than 18, as required to make such disclosure to Narrable and grant the following license. You, on behalf of your company or organization, grant, or your company or organization grants, to Narrable a nonexclusive license to view, download, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, and display information about Students you submit solely for the purposes of (a) providing the Service and (b) creating, using, and disclosing de-identified and/or aggregated information about Students.
  * As a part of the Teacher Account creation process, you will be asked (a) whether you will be providing your Course to Students under 13, and (b) whether you are a teacher or administrator at a school (for example, a K-6 public elementary school). You will only be permitted to provide a Course to Students under 13 if you are a teacher or administrator at a school.
