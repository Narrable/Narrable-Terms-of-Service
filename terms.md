## Teacher Accounts
Narrable will provide you with access to a Teacher Account, provided that you (1) provide any necessary information about you and/or your company or organization when registering the Account and (2) accept the Terms. Using your Teacher Account, you may create invitations for Student Accounts by generating invite codes that you may provide to your Students. You will be responsible for any activities, including any violation of the Terms, that occur under Student Accounts created using your Teacher Account.

## Student Accounts
To create an Account, you must (1) be provided with access to an account invite code by a Teacher, (2) provide us with any Registration Data requested in the registration form, and (3) accept the Terms.

## COPPA
The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through Narrable from a child under 13 where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use Narrable and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at info@narrable.com.

If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing Narrable. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use Narrable as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.

## Teacher Obligations

  * You are solely responsible for ensuring that you and your company or organization are compliant with all laws and regulations related to disclosing to Narrable the personal information of the Students you invite to create Accounts. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you represent and warrant, that you have provided the necessary notice and obtained the appropriate consents from the Students, or from the parents of the Student if such Student is younger than 18, as required to make such disclosure to Narrable and grant the following license. You, on behalf of your company or organization, grant, or your company or organization grants, to Narrable a nonexclusive license to view, download, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, and display information you submit about Students solely for the purposes of (a) providing the Service and (b) creating, using, and disclosing de-identified and/or aggregated information about Students.
